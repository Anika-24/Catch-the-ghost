Catch The Ghost

In this spooky platformer game, you control a ghost trying to stay alive while dodging falling platforms and climbing obstacles. The tower scrolls down, and the ghost can jump, move left or right. If the ghost touches a climber, it stops falling, but if it falls too far, the game ends with a "GAME OVER" message. Platforms (doors and climbers) spawn regularly, keeping the game challenging and fast-paced! It's all set against a creepy background with a spooky sound for extra thrill!
